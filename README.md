# 2D Platformer Game Kit

> A project created in **Unity** for people who want to learn more or have a quick way to make **2D Platformer games.** Coded in C#.

> Inspired by **Super Mario Maker**, **Ninja Arashi** (a mobile game) and **Donkey Kong Country**, this kit allows developers to incorporate the following:
- The usual 2D platformer Player elements (jumping, double jumping, walking/running, wall sliding, dodging, attacking of enemies)
- Versatile set of skills, patrol behavior, attributes and effects that you can mix and match for any in-game character with AI
- Ready-to-use prefabs for enemies and traps
- Customized UI Elements (from texts down to buttons and panels)
- HOT: Chibi art style + animation
- HOT: Dialogue and Cutscene system (for story-telling)

## Demo Levels
The project contains **4 demo levels** for level design tutorial.

## Plugins/libraries/tools used in the project:
- Zenject (for dependency injection)
- UniRx (for reactive extensions)
- TextMeshPro (for way better 2D texts; seriously, Unity should replace its default UI texts with TextMeshPro already)
- Cartoon FX Prefabs (downloaded from Unity Asset Store)

## Assets:
- All art assets + animations except the backgrounds (clouds, mountains, gradient skies) were created by your truly.
- The 2D game backgrounds (clouds, mountains, gradient skies, etc.) were downloaded as free assets from itch.io
- Animations were created by yours truly and exported frame by frame from Anime Studio Pro.
- Static art assets were created by me and exported from Manga Studio 5 EX.
- Player SFX's were voiced by yours truly.
- All the other SFX's were downloaded as free assets from freesound.org and Unity Asset Store.
- All BGM's are from Incompetech.com / Kevin MacLeod. I do not own these awesomely free music pieces.
